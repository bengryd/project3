        <p>
            Traveling has always been an important part of my life. When I travel I want to see some of the iconic
            tourist destinations, but the real draw for me is getting immersed into the culture around me.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are some places in the world that don’t just impress you — they stay with you. For me, that place is
            Hoi An, a small riverside town on Vietnam’s central coast that feels like it was designed to slow time down.
            The moment you step into its lantern-lit streets, surrounded by centuries-old buildings, the aroma of fresh
            herbs, and the hum of life along the Thu Bon River, you realize you’re somewhere truly special.
        </p>

        <p>
            Hoi An isn’t just beautiful — it’s alive in a way few cities are. It’s a blend of history and modern
            creativity, where ancient architecture meets artisan shops, vibrant markets, and world-class street food.
            Whether you’re exploring its peaceful rice fields by bike, savoring a bowl of cao lầu noodles, or watching
            lanterns float across the water at dusk, every moment feels effortless and memorable.

            <h2 class="shopping">Shopping</h2>

            <p>
                Shopping in Hoi An is more than just browsing — it’s an experience in creativity and craftsmanship. The
                town has earned its reputation as Vietnam’s tailoring capital, where skilled artisans can transform
                fabric and leather into perfectly fitted, custom-made pieces in just a day or two. From elegant suits
                and flowing dresses to hand-stitched shoes and leather bags, Hoi An’s workshops blend traditional
                techniques with modern style. Walking through the narrow streets, you’ll find rows of tailor shops and
                leather studios, each buzzing with the sound of sewing machines and the energy of artisans bringing
                ideas to life. Whether you come with a design in mind or let the experts guide you, having something
                made here is not just shopping — it’s a personal souvenir of the city’s artistry and charm.

                    results, making it a top choice for tailor-made fashion in Hoi An. This is where I chose to have my

            <h2 class="nightlife">Night Life</h2>
            <p>
                When night falls over the Thu Bon River, Hoi An undergoes a breathtaking transformation. The quiet,
                easygoing rhythm of the day gives way to a lively, enchanting atmosphere as thousands of silk lanterns
                illuminate every street, bridge, and doorway in the Ancient Town. The entire town seems to glow — soft
                yellows, deep reds, and vibrant blues reflecting off the old walls and cobblestones, creating a scene
                that feels almost dreamlike. As music drifts from riverside bars and laughter fills the air, people
                gather to play street games, sip cocktails, and savor the aromas of sizzling skewers and fresh noodles
                from food stalls. Boats carrying floating lanterns glide gently down the river, mirroring the lights
                above, while the streets pulse with a warm, festive energy. Hoi An’s nightlife isn’t wild or
                overwhelming — it’s alive in a way that feels both magical and deeply human, a nightly celebration of
                light, food, and community.
            </p>
            <h3>Top Activities</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Lantern Watching and Floating:</strong> You can explore the town admiring the thousands of
                    lanterns illuminating the streets and buildings. You can also release lanterns into the river while
                    making a wish. For a unique view, you can opt to hire a small boat to take you through the town at
                    night.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Riverside Bars and Live Music:</strong> The intimate settings let you enjoy music while
                    sipping cocktails or local beverages, all under the glow of lanterns.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Street Food Exploration:</strong> Wander from vendor to vendor as you sample an endless
                    array of grilled skewers, fresh seafood, sweet coconut desserts, and other Vietnamese favorites. My
                    favorite was the grilled calamari.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Night Markets:</strong> Amongst other options, the night market blends shopping and culture
                    through the town's unique offerings of handmade silk lanterns. We couldn't resist and have six of
                    them lighting our deck through the Spring and Summer.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Traditional Games and Cultural Performances:</strong> Participate in simple folk games or
                    watch local performances in the Old Town squares.

            <p>
                Hoi An and its surrounding countryside offer a rich mix of outdoor activities that blend adventure,
                culture, and local life. For tourists, there’s biking through lush rice paddies, exploring quaint
                villages, or taking a guided boat tour along the Thu Bon River to enjoy the scenery and spot traditional
                fishing methods. Nearby beaches like An Bang and Cua Dai are perfect for swimming, sunbathing, or trying
                water sports like stand-up paddleboarding. For a more cultural experience, visitors can visit Tra Que
                Vegetable Village to help with planting or harvesting, learn traditional basket weaving in Cam Thanh
                Coconut Village, or join a cooking class that begins with a market tour of local produce. There are also
                day trips to the Marble Mountains or the My Son Sanctuary, offering hiking, history, and stunning views.

                <li>
                    <strong>Hoi An Tropical Cooking Tour:</strong> This was a fantastic cultural experience! We not only
                    got to learn how to prepare and cook fried spring rolls, papaya salad, and our choice of a
                    traditional Vietnamese meal, but we also got to go to the market to get our ingredients and explore
                    the fishing village to observe how some of the protein is sourced daily. These dishes will be passed
                    down through generations in my family, truly bringing something back that is invaluable!
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>My Son Sanctuary:</strong> An ancient Cham archaeological site located in a lush valley in
                    central Vietnam. Once the spiritual and political center of the Champa Kingdom (4th–13th centuries),
                    it features over 70 red-brick temple towers dedicated mainly to the Hindu god Shiva. Despite damage
                    from natural decay and wartime bombings, the site remains a striking example of Cham architecture
                    and religious art, and it is recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Marble Mountains:</strong> Marble Mountains is a cluster of five limestone and marble hills
                    near Da Nang and Hoi An, each named after one of the five elements. The site features caves,
                    Buddhist pagodas, Hindu shrines, and scenic viewpoints overlooking the coastline. At the base, the
                    Non Nuoc stone‑carving village showcases traditional marble craftsmanship, making it a popular
                    destination for both natural beauty and cultural heritage.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Tra Que Vegetable Village:</strong> See how the produce is planted and harvested for the
                    dishes you made throughout the cooking class! Doing this hands on is an experience like no other to
                    connect with the locals and get a glimpse into their life.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Biking Through Rice Paddies:</strong> This was not something we planned to do, but we are so
                    grateful that we did. Our hostel rented out bicycles for free, and we decided to ride and see where
                    it took us. We did not have a route or a plan. This ended up allowing us to escape the tourist traps
                    in ways that we never expected. We rode through small trails around and through the rice paddies
                    where we would come to unexpected sights, animals, or farming villages. Notably, our journey came to
                    a temporary pause when a water buffalo was blocking the trail.
